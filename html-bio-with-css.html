      <p>My name is Peter Mun and I am 34 years old. I was born in Pennsylvania. As a child I loved to play basketball and video games with my friends.
        After graduating highschool I decided to join the Army. The Army was a great experience and helped me to jump start my life and learn responsibility.
        I served 4 years active duty and had the opportunity to serve over seas twice. Now I am currently working at a small company called Phoenix Business computing.
